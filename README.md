Collection of Cybersecurity Notes

I want this repository to be a hub of resources. I've often run into an issue when working on a CTF problem, or preparing for an interview, or tackling a box, where I have to look up what tool would be the best to use and sometimes there are those annoying Steg challenges that require you to know certain tools to get the flag. 

When I was also preparing for an interview, there was no specific structure for Cybersecurity Interviews, so I want this repo to be a resource for anyone preparing for interviews or a quick read on some topics.
